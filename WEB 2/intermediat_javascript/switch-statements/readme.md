# Description
1. The web application will take in a list of numbers that the user will enter. These numbers can be placed in any order separated by a comma. 
2. Once the user has entered their numbers, users can use the input to choose the type of statistics they would like to calculate from the list of numbers they have entered. 
3. From there, we use the **Switch Statement** to determine which formula we would want to apply to the list of numbers provided to us.
